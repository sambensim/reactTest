### Assassin
See [here](https://steemit.com/gaming/@decimus/how-to-play-assassins-the-best-community-game-ever) 
- Each Player assigned a random other player as target and obscure-ish word, phrase, or action before game start
- A player may kill their target by getting them alone in a room or by getting them to say their given phrase or word
- On kill, the victim gives their contract to their killer
- If there is a dispute about weather or not a kill succeeded it will be put to a vote, if it is decided that it didn't, the killer will join teams with the victim
- Last assassin standing wins. If multiple are alive, the one with the most kills wins.
- Game starts 5 minutes after the sixth person enters the building.
- Players cannot be killed with the alone method when outside or in the bathroom.

##### Program
[Here!](https://www.samsimmons.info/Assassin)
- Buttons and text form from UIVerse
- Guarantees no dead ends (when an individual kills someone and absorbs their target, which is themselves) by putting all names in a randomized list and giving each player the name four places after their own name (four is arbitrary).
- The list is always shuffled the same way after reloads and across devices because I took random number generation code from StackOverflow which allows me to set the seed (this is currently hardcoded, but the seed could be given by a "game number" or code that all players type in).
